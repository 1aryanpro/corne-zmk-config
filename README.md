# aryanpro's Corne Keymap

This is a simplistic keymap for my 6 column wireless corne keyboard. There are 5
layers:
* Default: alphabet + homerow mods
* Lower (Number): numpad and math symbols on the right, and modifiers on the left
* Raise (Symbol): left side contains programming symbols and right side math symbols
* Caps: vim arrow keys on the right side and modifiers on the left
* Steno: has keys needed for Plover steno to work properly
